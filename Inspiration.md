# Inspiration for this GitHub Approach

## Desire for Open Collaboration
The main reason for developing the GitHub site for the BIM Project Execution Planning development efforts is to maximize the opportunity for open collaboration.

## Inspired by Other Products
There were several products / initiatives that inspired our team to pursue this approach.  They include:
- buildingSMART Alliance Thought Leadership Subcommitte:  This subcommittee started our conversations into a new approach.  We'd like to thank Kimon Onuma for initiating this discussion.
- The HoTT Book project:  This is a very interesting collaborative book approach hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/HoTT/book  You can read more at https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/  This project leverages both collaboration and the use of LaTeX for publishing.
- GSA 18F Project:  This repository includes a great example of open publishing on the web.
