# Inspiration for this GitHub Approach

## Desire for Open Collaboration
The main reason for developing the GitHub site for the BIM Project Execution Planning development efforts is to maximize the opportunity for open collaboration.

## Inspired by Other Products
There were several products / initiatives that inspired our team to pursue this approach.  They include:
- buildingSMART Alliance Thought Leadership Subcommitte:  This subcommittee started our conversations into a new approach.  We'd like to thank Kimon Onuma for initiating this discussion.
- The HoTT Book project:  This is a very interesting collaborative book approach hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/HoTT/book  You can read more at https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/  This project leverages both collaboration and the use of LaTeX for publishing.
- GSA 18F Project:  This repository includes a great example of open publishing on the web.  The GitHub repository can be found at https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov  You can read more at https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/03/how-to-use-github-and-the-terminal-a-guide/  There are also various examples at http://gsa.github.io/github-federal-stats/
- Clay Shirky provided an interesting TED talk related to GitHub and open collaboration.  It is titled How the Internet will (one day) Transform government: https://youtu.be/CEN4XNth61o
