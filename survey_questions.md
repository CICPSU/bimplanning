# Survey Questionaire - Draft Questions

## Introduction:
We are currently working to develop a new version of the BIM project execution planning (PXP) guide. This survey is focused on helping us to identify the highest value areas to improve. As a person who has previously downloaded our guide and templates, we would greatly appreciate you take 5 â€“ 10 minutes to share your feedback.

We will be reviewing the comments and putting together a more detailed plan to release a BIM PXP 2017 update with minor revisions, along with a future BIM PXP 2018 that contains more significant revisions.
